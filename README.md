# MiscellaneousElementSet
An Omeka plugin that adds a new element set for storing ... whatever. May be useful for developers and admins who need somewhere to store non-content data for individual items or collections. For example, you could add shortcodes to a few specific item records, or configure a hero image or other display parameters for each collection, then use those in your theme templates.
